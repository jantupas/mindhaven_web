                We envision the development of a child, <br /><br />
                WHO is physically, emotionally, intellectually, socially, mentally, and  spiritually well-balanced. <br /><br />
                WHO is capable of choices and responsible for his conduct. <br /><br />
                WHERE education would help him discover a field where his talents best suit him. <br /><br />
                WHERE he will be satisfied and competent so that he will become a responsible and productive member of the society.

            <h1>Mission</h1>
            <p>
                To provide a childâ€“oriented environment where children can be motivated as individuals to fulfill their 
                potentials and build a lifetime base of strong self-esteem.
